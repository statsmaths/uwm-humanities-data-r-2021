## Code of Conduct

Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as
soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value
of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you
make our event a better place.

## Setup

In order to install the course materials locally on your computer, you will need to
install three components. Links for this are given below; if you are not familiar with
installing programming components on your local machine, we suggest waiting until
after the workshop to follow these steps.

- [R Programming language](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- [course notebooks and datasets](https://github.com/statsmaths/uwm-humanities-data-r-2021/raw/main/uwm-humanities-data-r-2021.zip)

## Schedule

This workshop will focus on giving an overview of how R can be used to perform a variety
of data analysis tasks relevant in the Humanities. Due to the short duration of the workshop,
we will focus on the showcasing the possibilities or using R. With this in mind, the
workshop will (tentatively) be organized as follows:

- **(09:00-09:30)** Introductions and Setup (Notebook01)
- **(09:30-10:00)** Data Visualization (Notebook02)
- **(10:00-10:10)** *break*
- **(10:10-10:45)** Textual Analysis (Notebook03)
- **(10:45-11:20)** Network Analysis (Notebook04)
- **(11:20-11:30)** *break*
- **(11:30-12:00)** Spatial Analysis and Wrap-up (Notebook05)

We will be available after the workshop to assist participants looking to see how to extend
the materials to their own datasets.
