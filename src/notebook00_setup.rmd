## Setup

This notebook installs all of the packaged needed for the other notebooks. If running the
code on RStudio Cloud, in theory you should not need to re-run this. On your own machine,
this is needed before proceeding through the other notebooks. See Notebook01 for information
about how to run R code and how code is structure into packages.

```{r}
install.packages(
  pkgs = c(
    "readr", "ggplot2", "stringi", "forcats", "ggrepel", "tidyr",
    "Hmisc", "cleanNLP", "devtools", "ggimg", "lubridate", "cleanNLP",
    "igraph", "USAboundaries", "sf"
  ),
  repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/",
  quiet = FALSE
)
```
